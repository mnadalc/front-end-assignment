## Hurtigruten frontend assignment

This project allows Hurtigruten to asses potential frontend candidates with real, working code.

You have two options.

### Send in your own project

If you have an existing pet project or something that you are proud of and using the following technologies, send it to us.

- One of the modern JavaScript frameworks
- TypeScript
- CSS (preferably not a library like Bootstrap)
- Tests

### Choose our assignment

Spend only **2-3 hours** on this assignment, don't worry if you can't finish it.

You will find the exercises in the [exercises.md](./exercises.md) file.

We have bootstrapped this assignment with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to give you the initial setup.

**If you feel strongly about using other frameworks (such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Angular](https://angular.io/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), libraries or tools you are free to do so!**
